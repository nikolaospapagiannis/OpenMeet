## 🚨 RISKS & MITIGATION

### Technical Risks

**Risk:** AI costs spiral (OpenAI API)
**Mitigation:** Implement caching, move to self-hosted models for high-volume (Whisper.cpp, Llama), tiered AI credits

**Risk:** Video storage costs too high
**Mitigation:** Compress videos aggressively, auto-delete after retention period, upsell unlimited storage

**Risk:** Scale issues at 50K+ users
**Mitigation:** Load testing at each phase, database sharding early, CDN for static assets

### Market Risks

**Risk:** Fireflies/Otter release competing features
**Mitigation:** Move faster, differentiate on price + enterprise features, self-hosted moat

**Risk:** Gong acquires a competitor
**Mitigation:** Focus on SMB market they ignore, be acquisition target ourselves

**Risk:** Slow enterprise sales cycle
**Mitigation:** Product-led growth (PLG) with generous free tier, land-and-expand strategy

### Execution Risks

**Risk:** Can't hire fast enough
**Mitigation:** Remote-first (global talent pool), contract developers, engineering brand building

**Risk:** Feature creep delays launch
**Mitigation:** Strict scoping, MVP first, fast iterations, ruthless prioritization

**Risk:** Churn higher than expected
**Mitigation:** Customer success team early, in-app onboarding, proactive support, NPS tracking

## 🎉 VISION: 12 MONTHS FROM NOW

**Market Position:** Top 3 Meeting Intelligence Platform
**Users:** 200,000 active, 10,000 paid
**Revenue:** $1M MRR ($12M ARR)
**Valuation:** $120M+ (10x ARR, pre-Series B)
**Team:** 33 people across engineering, product, sales, marketing
**Features:** 100+ features, 80% matching leaders + 20% unique
**Recognition:** G2 Top 3, TechCrunch coverage, Gartner Cool Vendor

**The Dream:**
A user opens their laptop Monday morning. They have 5 meetings scheduled. Fireff automatically joins each one, transcribes in real-time with live captions, and after each meeting, sends a beautiful summary with action items to their inbox. Between meetings, they open the Fireff app and ask "What did my team agree to this week?" The AI instantly scans 47 meetings and responds with a synthesized answer, linking to specific moments. Their sales manager gets an alert: "Deal with Acme Corp is at risk - no exec sponsor identified." Their recruiting team uses AI scorecards to objectively evaluate 50 candidates. Their support team sees sentiment dropping and proactively reaches out to unhappy customers. All of this costs $25/user/month, 1/5 the price of Gong, and it just works.

**That's the future we're building. Let's get started.**
