# ✅ ACTUAL FIX - contextMenus Permission Missing

## The Real Problem

**Error**: `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'onClicked')`
**Location**: `background.js:409`

### Root Cause
The `manifest.json` was **missing** the `"contextMenus"` permission.

Background.js uses:
```javascript
// Line 32-52: Creates context menu items
chrome.contextMenus.create({...})

// Line 409: Listens for clicks
chrome.contextMenus.onClicked.addListener(...)
```

Without the permission, `chrome.contextMenus` is `undefined`, causing the TypeError.

## ✅ Fix Applied

**Added to manifest.json line 15:**
```json
"permissions": [
  "activeTab",
  "storage",
  "tabs",
  "scripting",
  "notifications",
  "webRequest",
  "cookies",
  "contextMenus"  ← ADDED THIS
],
```

---

## 🔄 Reload the Extension

**IMPORTANT**: You must reload for the new permission to take effect.

```bash
chrome://extensions/
→ Find "OpenMeet Meeting Recorder"
→ Click reload button (↻)
```

---

## ✅ Expected Result

After reload:
- ✅ No errors in service worker console
- ✅ Extension loads successfully
- ✅ Service worker shows: "[OpenMeet] Background service worker initialized"
- ✅ Right-click on meeting pages → See "Start Recording" / "Stop Recording" context menu

---

## 🧪 Test It

### Test 1: Service Worker Loads
```
chrome://extensions/
→ Extension → "Service Worker"

```

### Test 2: Context Menu Works
```
1. Go to https://meet.google.com/xxx-xxxx-xxx
